## Overview

This IoT-driven platform detects vehicle accidents using sensors (like accelerometers/vibration modules) and instantly transmits GPS-based location alerts via SMS, dashboard updates, or other alerts. The goal: minimize response times and increase survival chances.

---

## Features

* **Accident Detection:** Sensor-based crash detection (accelerometer/vibration)
* **Location Tracking:** Instant GPS coordinate capture upon detection
* **Alert System:** Notifications sent via SMS, email, or IoT dashboard
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous update of device status and alerts

---

## Technologies Used

* **Hardware:** Arduino, ESP8266, or NodeMCU; accelerometer; GPS module; GSM/SMS module
* **Software:** Embedded C/C++, Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO); libraries like `TinyGPS`, `SoftwareSerial`, `Adafruit_Sensor`
* **Communication:** HTTP or MQTT for dashboards, SMS services (e.g. Twilio or standard GSM SMS)
* **Database/UI (optional):** MySQL, ThingSpeak, or a custom web/mobile interface

---

## Prerequisites

* **Hardware Components:**

  * Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP8266 / NodeMCU)
  * Accelerometer sensor
  * GPS module
  * GSM module and active SIM card

* **Software Requirements:**

  * Arduino IDE or PlatformIO installed
  * Required libraries (TinyGPS, SoftwareSerial, Adafruit\_Sensor, etc.)

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manishb311/accident_detection_and_tracking_system.git
   ```
2. Build the hardware setup according to your circuit diagram (add or reference schematic here).
3. Open the code in Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO) and install necessary libraries.
4. Upload firmware to your microcontroller.
5. Configure GSM module with the correct APN and phone number(s) for alerts.

---

## How It Works

1. Sensors continuously monitor motion and detect sudden impacts.
2. On crash detection, the GPS module retrieves current coordinates.
3. The GSM module sends an alert (SMS or dashboard update) containing location and incident details.
4. Users or a centralized system can then dispatch help promptly.

---

## Usage

* Mount the device securely in a vehicle and power it up.
* Ensure all modules (sensor, GPS, GSM) initialize successfully.
* On collision, verify that alerts are delivered to intended recipients or platform.

---

## Customization

* Adjust crash sensitivity thresholds in the firmware as needed.
* Extend functionality with web or mobile dashboards (analytics, mapping, logs).
* Add email support or integrate alternate messaging platforms.
