Accident Detection and Tracking System
An IoT-based project for automatic vehicle accident detection and real-time location tracking, designed to enhance road safety by enabling immediate emergency response.

Overview
This project uses IoT sensors and embedded hardware to automatically detect road accidents and transmit the vehicle's precise location to a monitoring system or emergency contacts. The goal is to reduce response time and potentially save lives by ensuring that help is dispatched as soon as an incident occurs.

Features
Accident detection: Utilizes sensors (like accelerometers and vibration modules) to recognize crash events.

Location tracking: Captures GPS coordinates at the moment of an accident.

Alert system: Sends an alert (SMS, email, or IoT dashboard update) with precise accident location details.

Real-time monitoring: Enables remote tracking and system status monitoring.

Technologies Used
Hardware: Arduino/ESP8266/NodeMCU (specify your board), accelerometer, GPS module, GSM/SMS module

Software: Embedded C/C++ for firmware, IoT dashboard/web app (if any)

Communication: HTTP/MQTT protocols, SMS services (like Twilio)

Database/UI: (If applicable: MySQL, ThingSpeak, custom web interface)

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Arduino IDE or PlatformIO

Required libraries (e.g., TinyGPS, SoftwareSerial, Adafruit_Sensor)

Components: Arduino/ESP board, GPS module, accelerometer sensor, GSM module/SIM card

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Manishb311/accident_detection_and_tracking_system.git
Assemble hardware as per the circuit schematic (add schematic image or link if available).

Install required Arduino libraries using Library Manager.

Upload the code to your microcontroller.

Configure GSM module with correct APN and SMS destination numbers.

How It Works
The sensor suite continuously monitors for unusual acceleration or vibration patterns.

When an accident is detected, the GPS module fetches the current location.

The GSM module sends an SMS alert with the location to predefined contacts or updates a web platform.

The system can be monitored and tested for real-time status and event logs.

Usage
Mount the hardware in the target vehicle.

Power on the device; ensure all modules (sensor, GPS, GSM) indicate readiness.

In case of a collision, observe the alert sent to the configured contacts/platform.

Customization
Modify threshold values in the code based on vehicle/environment.

Integrate with web or mobile dashboard for advanced analytics (optional).
